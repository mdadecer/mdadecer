- 👋 Hi, I’m @mdadecer, or michael.
- 👀 I’m interested in computer security and database management.
- 🌱 I’m currently @ YorkU for Computer Science (Ba), but on my free time I'm learning MySQL and studying for my CompTIA+ Security cert.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! Just throw a message my way:)
- 📫 How to reach me: @mdadecer on LinkedIn, or here. I don't have Twitter, sorry!
